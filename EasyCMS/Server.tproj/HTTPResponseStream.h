    File:       RTSPResponseStream.h

    Contains:   Object that provides a "buffered WriteV" service. Clients
                can call this function to write to a socket, and buffer flow
                controlled data in different ways.
                
                It is derived from StringFormatter, which it uses as an output
                stream buffer. The buffer may grow infinitely.
