    File:       HTTPRequestStream.h

    Contains:   Provides a stream abstraction for RTSP. Given a socket, this object
                can read in data until an entire RTSP request header is available.
                (do this by calling ReadRequest). It handles RTSP pipelining (request
                headers are produced serially even if multiple headers arrive simultaneously),
                & RTSP request data.
