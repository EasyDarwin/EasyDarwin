    File:       HTTPRequestStream.h

    Contains:   Provides a stream abstraction for HTTP. Given a socket, this object
                can read in data until an entire HTTP request header is available.
                (do this by calling ReadRequest). It handles HTTP pipelining (request
                headers are produced serially even if multiple headers arrive simultaneously),
                & HTTP request data.
