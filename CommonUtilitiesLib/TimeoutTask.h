	 File:       TimeoutTask.h

	 Contains:   Just like a normal task, but can be scheduled for timeouts. Unlike
				 IdleTask, which is VERY aggressive about being on time, but high
				 overhead for maintaining the timing information, this is a low overhead,
				 low priority timing mechanism. Timeouts may not happen exactly when
				 they are supposed to, but who cares?
