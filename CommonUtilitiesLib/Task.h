	 File:       Task.h

	 Contains:   Tasks are objects that can be scheduled. To schedule a task, you call its
				 signal method, and pass in an event (events are bits and all events are defined
				 below).

				 Once Signal() is called, the task object will be scheduled. When it runs, its
				 Run() function will get called. In order to clear the event, the derived task
				 object must call GetEvents() (which returns the events that were sent).

				 Calling GetEvents() implicitly "clears" the events returned. All events must
				 be cleared before the Run() function returns, or Run() will be invoked again
				 immediately.
