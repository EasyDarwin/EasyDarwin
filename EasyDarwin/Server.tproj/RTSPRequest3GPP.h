 5.3.2.2 The 3GPP-Adaptation header
 To enable PSS clients to set bit-rate adaptation parameters, a new RTSP request and response header is defined. The
 header can be used in the methods SETUP, PLAY, OPTIONS, and SET_PARAMETER.  The header defined in ABNF
 [53] has the following syntax:
 3GPP-adaptation-def = "3GPP-Adaptation" ":" adaptation-spec 0*("," adaptation-spec)
 adaptation-spec = url-def *adapt-params
 adapt-params = ";" buffer-size-def
	  / ";" target-time-def
 url-def  = "url" "=" <"> url <">
 buffer-size-def  = "size" "=" 1*9DIGIT ; bytes
 target-time-def  = "target-time" "=" 1*9DIGIT; ms
 url              = ( absoluteURI / relativeURI )
 absoluteURI and relativeURI are defined in RFC 2396 [60] and updated in RFC 2732 [61]. The base URI for any
 relative URI is the RTSP request URI.
 The "3GPP-Adaptation" header shall be sent in responses to requests containing this header. The PSS server shall not
 change the values in the response header. The presence of the header in the response indicates to the client that the
 server acknowledges the request.
 The buffer size signalled in the "3GPP-Adaptation" header shall correspond to reception, de-jittering, and, if used, de-
 interleaving buffer(s) that have this given amount of space for complete application data units (ADU), including the
 following RTP header and RTP payload header fields: RTP timestamp, and sequence numbers or decoding order
 numbers. The specified buffer size shall also include any Annex G pre-decoder buffer space used for this media, as the
 two buffers cannot be separated.
 The target protection time signalled in the value of the "target-time" parameter is the targeted minimum buffer level or,
 in other words, the client desired amount of playback time in milliseconds to guarantee interrupt-free playback and
 allow the server to adjust the transmission rate, if needed.

/*
5.3.2.1 The 3GPP-Link-Char header
To enable PSS clients to report the link characteristics of the radio interface to the PSS server, the "3GPP-Link-Char"
RTSP header is defined. The header takes one or more arguments. The reported information should be taken from a
QoS reservation (i.e. the QoS profile as defined in [56]). Note that this information is only valid for the wireless link
and does not apply end-to-end. However, the parameters do provide constraints that can be used.

Three parameters are defined that can be included in the header, and future extensions are possible to define. Any
unknown parameter shall be ignored. The three parameters are:
- "GBW": the link's guaranteed bit-rate in kilobits per second as defined by [56];
- "MBW": the link's maximum bit-rate in kilobits per second as defined by [56];
- "MTD": the link's maximum transfer delay, as defined by [56] in milliseconds.
The "3GPP-Link-Char" header syntax is defined below using ABNF [53]:
3gpplinkheader  = "3GPP-Link-Char" ":" link-char-spec *("," 0*1SP link-char-spec) CRLF
link-char-spec  = char-link-url *(";" 0*1SP link-parameters)
char-link-url  = "url" "=" <">url<">
link-parameters  = Guaranteed-BW / Max-BW / Max-Transfer-delay / extension-type
Guaranteed-BW  = "GBW" "=" 1*DIGIT  ; bps
Max-BW  = "MBW" "=" 1*DIGIT ; bps
Max-Transfer-delay  = "MTD" "=" 1*DIGIT ; ms
extension-type   = token "=" (token / quoted-string)
DIGIT  = as defined in RFC 2326 [5]
token  = as defined in RFC 2326 [5]
quoted-string  = as defined in RFC 2326 [5]
url   = as defined in RFC 2326 [5]
The "3GPP-Link-Char" header can be included in a request using any of the following RTSP methods: SETUP, PLAY,
OPTIONS, and SET_PARAMETER. The header shall not be included in any response. The header can contain one or
more characteristics specifications. Each specification contains a URI that can either be an absolute or a relative, any
relative URI use the RTSP request URI as base. The URI points out the media component that the given parameters
apply to. This can either be an individual media stream or a session aggregate.
If a QoS reservation (PDP context) is shared by several media components in a session the 3GPP-Link-Char header
shall not be sent prior to the RTSP PLAY request. In this case the URI to use is the aggregated RTSP URI. If the QoS
reservation is not shared (one PDP context per media) the media stream URI must be used in the 3GPP-Link-Char
specification. If one QoS reservation (PDP context) per media component is used, the specification parameters shall be
sent per media component.
The "3GPP-Link-Char" header should be included in a SETUP or PLAY request by the client, to give the initial values
for the link characteristics. A SET_PARAMETER or OPTIONS request can be used to update the 3GPP-Link-Char
values in a session currently playing. It is strongly recommended that SET_PARAMETER is used, as this has the
correct semantics for the operation and also requires less overhead both in bandwidth and server processing. When
performing updates of the parameters, all of the previous signalled values are undefined and only the given ones in the
update are defined. This means that even if a parameter has not changed, it must be included in the update.

Example:
3GPP-LinkChar: url="rtsp://server.example.com/media.3gp"; GBW=32; MBW=128; MTD=2000

In the above example the header tells the server that its radio link has a QoS setting with a guaranteed bit-rate of 32
kbps, a maximum bit-rate of 128 kbps, and a maximum transfer delay of 2.0 seconds. These parameters are valid for the
aggregate of all media components, as the URI is an aggregated RTSP URI.
